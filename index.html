                  The main focus of this project was creating a responsive website about a given subject - in this case, flat design. It is the second website I have ever
                  created and my first attempt at achieving responsiveness. It is not included here because I feel particularly proud about this project - but because
                  it's now been one year since I created it and it marks the beginning of my journey with coding, as well as helps to highlight the progress I have made
                  during this time.

                  This onboarding project is targeted at new and future students of Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. Using gamification techniques is meant to
                  make learning things about university easier and more pleasant, as well as rewarding. Taking a quiz during each "level" helps the user to memorise newly
                  acquired informations and serves as additional motivation. The final solution is a result of teamwork.

                  in broadening their knowledge about Danish culture.

                  Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                  years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
                  a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                  sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
                  the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
                  1.10.
